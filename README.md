# 📝 Feedback Board (Static Demo)

A lightweight **Feedback Board** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It loads demo feedback from an API and lets users post new comments — ideal for learning simple API interactions on the frontend.

## 📂 Files
- `index.html` — main page  
- `script.js` — handles fetching and posting feedback  
- `style.css` — layout and styling

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- On load, `loadFeedbacks()` fetches demo comments from `API_URL` (JSONPlaceholder).  
- Submitting the form sends a POST request and displays the new feedback card.

> Note: JSONPlaceholder is a fake API — data isn’t actually saved.  
> To use a real backend, replace the value of `API_URL` in `script.js`.
